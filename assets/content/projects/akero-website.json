This allowed me to build, make drastic changes and deploy quickly.\n\nSpeed was at the forefront of the site, since before it was a wordpress theme, with hundreds of plugins. Rebuilding allowed me to strip everything back. The feedback after launch was very positive, especially about the home page in general."
