It includes; a form builder, landing page builder, marketing automation, CRM, advertising reporting along with much more.\n\n## My Role\n\nI was hired to be the lead designer and take hold of front end  developer as it was currently being done by the backend devs.  \n\n## The product\n\nAbout 6 months into my role the idea of what Akero was had already started to drastically change, it was previously just used for capturing form submissions through facebook pages. The old design worked just fine for this, but there was going to be a plethora of new features coming so the decision was made to give the platform a redesign.\n\nThe previous design was very design heavy, so my first through was to clean it up by reducing the colour pallete and removing a lot of the visual noise."

Each user had their own use cases for each column in the table, so removing columns was not an option, we opted for a side scrolling table with sticky table headers along with options to customise which columns youâ€™d see and the order in which they are displayed.\n\nGiving the users the freedom to choose how they see their data increased user satisfaction and we were being sent feedback on how easy the table is to use. Great news!"
