It includes; a form builder, landing page builder, marketing automation, CRM, advertising management, reporting along with much more.\n\n## My Role\n\nI was hired to be the lead designer and take hold of the frontend as it was not very user focused.\n\n## The product\n\nAbout 6 months into my role the idea of what Akero was had already started to drastically change, it was previously just used for capturing form submissions through Facebook pages. The old design worked just fine for this, but there was going to be a plethora of new features coming so the decision was made to give the platform a redesign.\n\nThe previous design was very design-heavy, so my first thought was to clean it up by reducing the colour palette and removing a lot of the visual noise."

Each user had their own use cases for each column in the table, so removing columns was not an option, we opted for a side-scrolling table with sticky table headers along with options to customise which columns youâ€™d see.\n\nGiving the users the freedom to choose how they see their data increased user satisfaction and we were being sent feedback on how easy the table is to use."

With the landing page builder, clients could quickly put together a landing page along with a form to capture their data.\n\nI decided on the approach of using semi templated blocks which could be an image and text, a banner, etc. This allowed the client to be able to quickly build out pages whilst keeping the design consistent throughout the page. \n\nAfter some feedback and research, clients wanted a few more customisable features so these templated blocks became almost a layout after I added in variable content, where the user could add a text area, form, button, image, divider, or even custom HTML."

This was all done in house by the parent agency, but the process was slow, cumbersome, and messy; involving advertising assets and amendments going back and forth on emails, all whilst being updated on Net Suite. So we began to build out a platform that allows clients and the agency to have a more streamlined experience.\n\nThis involved creating a brief form for clients to fill out and then generate a plan based on platform preferences, their target audience, and the type of advertising they are using. Once this is all approved the agency user can start building a media plan, where they'll choose the platform, ad types, and dates the ads are running."

Always a suprise!"

Getting features shipped fast seemed quite odd sometimes as it might not be the best solution, but thankfully these things can be iterated on over and over."
