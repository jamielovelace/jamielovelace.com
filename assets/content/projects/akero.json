It includes; a form builder, landing page builder, marketing automation, CRM, advertising management, reporting along with much more.\n\n## My Role\n\nI was hired to be the lead designer and take hold of the frontend as it was not very user focused.\n\n## The product\n\nAbout 6 months into my role the idea of what Akero was had already started to drastically change, it was previously just used for capturing form submissions through Facebook pages. The old design worked just fine for this, but there was going to be a plethora of new features coming so the decision was made to give the platform a redesign.\n\nThe previous design was very design-heavy, so my first thought was to clean it up by reducing the colour palette and removing a lot of the visual noise."

This meant having to combine the two seperate versions so they didnt diverge. Actual *git merge hell*, due to the markup completely changing in most instances."

Each user had their own use cases for each column in the table, so removing columns was not an option, we opted for a side-scrolling table with sticky table headers along with options to customise which columns youâ€™d see.\n\nGiving the users the freedom to choose how they see their data increased user satisfaction and we were being sent feedback on how easy the table is to use."
